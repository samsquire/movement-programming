# movement-programming

Demo: https://dynamictables.chronological.repl.co

This is an exploratory visual programming technique that I designed based on the idea that programming and problem solving is often just logistics. We can program computers with point and click and graphically.

It is inspired by spreadsheets and assembly programming.

Instead of thinking **what instructions to run next** to get to a state or behaviour we want, we walk through the execution state of where things are currently and step-by-step directly decide what to do next with what we have, as a **movement**.

(The stack is a location)

The computer can do the boring work to infer the instruction of the movement that we selected.

The idea is that complicated algorithms can be inferred or invented by laypeople through patterns of movements around. Even untrained people can learn where to move things to get the results they want. The system generates the movement.

This idea fits into my vision that we can use puzzles and human intelligence to solve complicated problems and give everyone a way of earning income.
